# Minimum Number of Matches Problem in Heat Recovery Network Design

## Introduction

This proyect mainly replicates the investigation done by Letsios, Kouyialis and Misener using as reference both their [article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compchemeng.2018.03.002) and their [repository](https://github.com/dimletsios/min_matches_heuristics) available in GitHub. 

The mathematical optimization models and heuristics are implemented using Python 2.7.16 and Pyomo 5.6.7 using their [book](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319588193) as main reference for this package.
